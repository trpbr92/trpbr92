- I'm always working on my own <a href="https://markfreeman.tech/">personal website</a>, but who isn't?! 
- I'm building my new site in Gatsby and it will include a technical blog where I'll share my JavaScript Journey, to include tutorials and musings on React, Gatsby & Jamstack.
- I'm developing a Healthy Meal Planer that will help busy users plan and shop for their weekly meals.
### What's exciting right now? 
- I'm part of a very small, private, but strong and productive community of developers from around the world, all with varying skillsets and degrees of experience. Our collaboration has inspired the core of us to develop an open-source application. We know there are many other developers in a similar position, with lots to learn and lots to give. We want everyone to have the opportunity to benefit as much as we have. The application will be the tool that will help strangers meet, provide the means to support eachother, and work collaboratively on real-world projects. To form production teams, mentoring partnerships and long term friendships.
